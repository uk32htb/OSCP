Simple Network Managment Protocol (SNMP) :- Protocol to use monitor Network Devices. UDP port 161 is used for this protocol. 

We can run SNMP walk to check if any user name and password is used in the Cronjob (SNMP v1 and v2 will have cred in plain text) 
#snmpwalk -v2c -c <public/private> <IP address>

Most common community string is Public and Private 
If common string is not used, we can brute force the server to get “community string”
    #onesixtyone -c /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt <IP address>


Once we have the community string we can user “braa” to brute force the Individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them. 
#braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.* (This is the full syntax)
